# ðŸ“ˆ Portfolio Insights (Archived)

Portfolio Insights is a stock analysis and alerting tool that lets users search for stock data and create custom price alerts. It is built with a React frontend, a Python (FastAPI) backend, and a Go microservice for processing financial data, all deployed using AWS EC2, AWS RDS, AWS Amplify, Docker, and GitHub Actions.

Previously, this project was organized as a monorepo, but it has since been split into separate repositories for different parts of the platform. This monorepo is no longer maintained, and the up-to-date project can be found at https://github.com/portfolio-insights.

This monorepo is kept in an archived state primarily to preserve issue history. Commit history has been cleared to prevent duplicate activity in account history.
